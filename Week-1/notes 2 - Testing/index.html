# Problem Solving Skills

Technology comes and goes fast.

Problem solving skills are:
- Timeless
- Universal
- Cross-disciplinary

They are the *most important* skills you will learn on this course and the most valuable to employers.

# Our Main Tools

## Abstraction

Viewing something in general terms without focusing on its concrete details.

## Algorithm

A set of instructions, carried out in a specific order, that lead to a desired output.

(From Al-Khwarizimi, a Persian mathematician and scholar.)

Software is an elaborate algorithm, composed of many smaller algorithms.

# An algorithm for an algorithm

1. **THINK & ABSTRACT**. Make sure you ask any questions you need to help you understand the problem.
2. **BREAK IT DOWN** and focus on one part that you have an idea how to solve or begin with a really easy example.
3. **USE NATURAL LANGUAGE**. Think about how to solve this part. Use natural language, diagrams etc.
4. **WRITE PSEUDOCODE**
5. **TRANSLATE** pseudocode to code
6. **TEST**, ask whether it worked or why it didn't and consider edge cases.
7. **REPEAT** the process for further small part of the problem until finally you are ready to compose.

# Sample problem:

Your programme contains a list of student IDs in the format "stu2574413" where the final two numbers represent a year. Sometimes students in the list expire and need to be removed from the list.

Create a function that takes a list of IDs and an expiry year and removes any expired students from the list, returning a new list.

# Make Palindrome

For this problem, you need to create a function that takes a string as an argument. The string will contain letters only, no spaces or other characters. If the letters can be rearranged into a palindrome the function should return true. If not, the function should return false. NB the palindrome does not need to be a sensible English word.

# Sample problem: 

Users on longer flights like to start a second movie right when their first one ends, but they complain that the plane usually lands before they can see the ending. So you're building a feature for choosing two movies whose total runtimes will equal the exact flight length.

Write a function that takes a `flightLength` and a list of `movieLengths` and returns a boolean indicating whether there are two numbers in `movieLengths` whose sum equals `flightLength`.

# More Tips

### Hardcode/mock more difficult parts of the problem
### Try to predict your code before you run it
### Practice problems solving every day
### Don't get frustrated

# The 5 Elements of Effective Thinking

- Book by Michael Starbird. [Link to videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEo7ej2RhHszJy_77UXC8GJpb8LtW-dJT).
1. Understand deeply. Identify fundamental ideas and focus on understanding them deeply.
2. Make mistakes for the purpose of learning. Thinking about how to fix mistakes is a much better educational experience than getting something right the first time.
3. Ask questions. Always having a question is a way of seeing the world that leads to better understading.
4. Follow the flow of ideas. Look for connections and meaning, everything else is variations and applications of fundamental ideas.
5. Change. Always expecting change helps putting things into perspective.
